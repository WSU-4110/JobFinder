            <p class="description"><!--description-->The Detroit Institute of Arts, located in Midtown Detroit, Michigan, has one of the largest and most 
              significant art collections in the United States. With over 100 galleries, it covers 658,000 square feet with a major renovation 
              and expansion project completed in 2007 that added 58,000 square feet. The DIA collection is regarded as among the top six museums 
              in the United States with an encyclopedic collection which spans the globe from ancient Egyptian and European works to contemporary 
              art. Its art collection is valued in billions of dollars, up to $8.1 billion according to a 2014 appraisal. The DIA campus is located 
              in Detroit's Cultural Center Historic District, about two miles north of the downtown area, across from the Detroit Public Library 
              near Wayne State University. The museum building is highly regarded by architects. The original building, designed by Paul Philippe Cret, 
              is flanked by north and south wings with the white marble as the main exterior material for the entire structure. The campus is part of 
              the city's Cultural Center Historic District listed in the National Register of Historic Places.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Institute_of_Arts" target="_blank"><b><button>wikipedia</button></b></a></p>

              <p class="description"><!--description-->Basilica of Sainte Anne de Détroit was founded July 26, 1701 by French 
                colonists in New France, and is the second-oldest continuously operating Roman Catholic parish in the United States.
                The current Gothic Revival cathedral-styled church, built in 1886, is located at 1000 Ste. Anne Street in Detroit, 
                Michigan, in the Richard-Hubbard neighborhood, near the Ambassador Bridge, and the Michigan Central Station. At one 
                time it was the seat of a diocese that included French territory in Ontario, Canada south of the Detroit River. 
                Historically, the parish congregation has occupied eight different buildings. It was listed on the National Register 
                of Historic Places in 1976. The main entry to the Church faces a grand tree-lined, brick paved plaza. Reflecting 
                demographic changes in the city and region since the 1930s, the present parish is largely Latino in population. 
                On March 1, 2020, Pope Francis elevated the church to a minor basilica, the 86th such designation in the United States 
                and the third in Michigan.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Sainte_Anne_de_D%C3%A9troit" target="_blank"> <b><button>wikipedia</button></b></a></p>

            <p class="description"><!--description-->The Fox Theatre is a performing arts center located at 2211 Woodward Avenue in Downtown
              Detroit, Michigan, near the Grand Circus Park Historic District. Opened in 1928 as a flagship movie palace in the Fox Theatres
              chain, it was at over 5,000 seats the largest theater in the city. Designed by theater architect C. Howard Crane, it was 
              listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989 for its 
              architecture. The area surrounding the Fox is nicknamed Foxtown. The city's major performance centers and theatres emanate 
              from the Fox Theatre and Grand Circus Park Historic District and continue along Woodward Avenue toward the Fisher Theatre in 
              the city's New Center. The Fox has 5,048 seats. It is the largest surviving movie palace of the 1920s and the largest of the 
              original Fox Theatres. The Fox was fully restored in 1988. The adjacent office building houses the headquarters of Olympia 
              Entertainment and Little Caesars.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Theatre_(Detroit)" target="_blank"> <b><button>wikipedia</button></b></a></p><br>

                leading to reams of propaganda about the superiority of the Aryan race. Although Schmeling himself was not a member 
                of the Nazi party, the German government took many steps to ensure his compliance, like not allowing his family to 
                travel with him.
